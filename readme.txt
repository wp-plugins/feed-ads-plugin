Feed Ads will randomly insert text at the end of rss entries. Useful for ads, taglines, news, or links.

== Description ==
The Feed Ads Plugin adds text, which can be a link, image tag, or any valid html to the end rss feed entries. This is done randomly so that not every entry will have the text. In this way Wordpress admins can extend the usefulness of the feeds with advertising or links to other sites.

Please be careful to enter valid HTML. The plugin does not validate the HTML that you enter, so it is quite easy to break your RSS feed.

The plugin allows for different messages. The random factor can be adjusted so that 1 in 100 entries will have the text up to 100% of entries will show the text.
 
== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Enter the text to be displayed at the end of a feed entry.
5. Select the percentage time that the text will appear in an entry.
